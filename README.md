# 30-Days-of-Python-Asabeneh
Challenge 30 days of python
It is a challenge that I decided to start to help me prepare for some job interviews and it seemed like the right tool to teach a friend of mine about programming. We are doing the challenge day by day on the Google colab platform except for the first days that I did it in visual studio code, I will update the repository soon.
